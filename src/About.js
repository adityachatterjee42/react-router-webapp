        <h3>Hi there!</h3>
        <p>I'm currently a grad student at the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information School</a> at the <a href="https://uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Washington</a>, 
          where I'm studying Data Science and Human Computer Interaction.  </p>
        <p>Before joining the UW, 
          I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Communications Engineering at Manipal 
          Institute of Technology in Karnataka, India.</p>
        <p>My interests are at the intersection
          of computing, information, and the social sciences. I'm looking for research opportunities where I can explore these fields in tandem. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm also an amateur musician - as an undergrad I lead and occasionally played guitar for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGAQZZSzR0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudburst</a>.</p>
